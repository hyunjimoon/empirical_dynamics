- unified units, colored variables according to latent/measured, actionable/determined (orange-red-green-blue),

## Intended Story
- 100 weeks (2 years)

- Department with five professors and one administer.
- 40 tasks per week,
- standard workweek is 4 days per week, standard task completion rate is 2, standard test completion rate is 4 per week
- 40 = 5 professors * 2 tasks per day*professors * 4 days per week
- initial test frac ~ 4 * 1 * 4 / 40  = .4
2 tasks per week for professors, regulated by administer who tests .25 tasks per week giving .4 test fraction.

with more work rates (task/week),
1. cut corners (h/task)
2. overtime -  (h/week person)
3. hiring - person
