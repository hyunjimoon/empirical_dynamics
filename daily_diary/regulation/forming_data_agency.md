- what is needed for agysub? delete?
- should the sorting of size happen by agency or overall population? (`agency_size/sum(agency_size) > .1`); what could be the research hypothesis for comparing the two? compared to aggregated, (platform business efficiency: N^2, divided regulate inside: N, self-goverance)

- agency increase gradually, decrease radically (default ratio, by time), housing finance is more stable than export/import banking [[ExportB_HousingFinance.png]]

부분의 패턴이 묻혀버림, 밑에서부터
- when to spin-off (regulation)
- form-filling 
	- monthly: accountant, planning, need proposal early year
	- yearly: ruling party changes
	- become conservative, larger safety stock
- 
- is scaling analysis possible with space marginalization
```
def scale_plot(df):

	if time_space == "by_t": # TODO meaning of scaling analysis with marginalize over agency, one agency's time series is tricky for scaling analysis
```
- in `iter_forming` filter out agency < 3 years, < 100 empoloyees?

12.29
- number of agency from 98-21 [115, 111, 114, 115, 116, 115, 120, 120, 118, 119, 120, 122, 124, 126, 125, 126, 128, 125, 125, 125, 125, 128, 130] - total: 164
- top ten agency
