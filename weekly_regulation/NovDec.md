- go deeper and deeper [[Pasted image 20221215145106.png]]
- utility function? correspondance of backlog (capability)
	- e.g. Reorder Period (staffing??) [[Pasted image 20221215145353.png]]
	- exposing to future information pattern recognition [[Pasted image 20221215145707.png]]
- multiechelon (can have their own backlog?)
- fast but ugly cannot exist
- meaning of "not time but fraction" is 100 times faster
- top ten troll (should model being hitting by adversity; murphy's law)














## W1
- ratio: 
	- fraction done right:
	- fraction of time for checking:

### W4
#vyq unit of perceived and companity quality?
	- how to formulate the effect of upperbound of `effort on task to filling form frac`? (.2 when optimizing when time ratio is 1/4)
- p := ration of filling form / task completion as independent variable
- ![[Pasted image 20221130230943.png]]
- ![[dot8p_quality.png]]
- increasing p increases manager level (but it coudl be other direction i.e. manager's increase can cause nonmanagers to spend more time filling forms)

## W3
## done
- separated `quality based` and `task to be tested based`  which affects stocky and flowy nature of desired manager  
- verified great oscillation 
	- without `zidz`
	- without putting in equilibrium (task arriving = tr + tw, tr = tr_submit) 
- thought `tr = tr_submit` need improvement
- four components of model: nonmng, mng, task, quality each of them have q
- both manager and nonmanger can contribute to high quality.

-  two formulation of task-rework: [coflow and disaggregation](https://github.com/Data4DM/BayesSD/discussions/38#discussioncomment-4218516)

## during
- communicating on colors 
	- syntax: measured, latent, time fraction, fraction
	- semantic: actionable or most interested, time
	- overlaps: lower and upper bounds
### model
#vyq 
- quality assurance: the total amount of Task that is really tested, depends on the number of tests and the coverage of each test.
	- Task to be Tested/Testing Time*Task Finish Switch
- test running fraction = zidz(test running rate, tet)

## W4
- do you agree error rate = 0, manager = $\infty$ is baseline?
